# FedEx RecoverAI: Intelligent DCA Management Platform

### 🚀 Overview
[cite_start]**FedEx RecoverAI** is a digital ecosystem designed to transform the current manual and fragmented Debt Collection Agency (DCA) management process[cite: 6]. [cite_start]By moving away from spreadsheets and emails [cite: 8][cite_start], we provide a centralized, AI-driven platform for enterprise-grade recovery[cite: 13, 14].

### 🛠️ Core Solutions
* [cite_start]**Centralized Case Management**: Replaces manual Excel tracking with a unified portal for case allocation and closure[cite: 14].
* [cite_start]**AI Prioritization Engine**: Uses ML logic to predict recovery probability, ensuring agencies focus on high-impact accounts[cite: 20, 27].
* [cite_start]**SOP-Driven Workflows**: Enforces strict SLAs and automated governance to reduce escalations[cite: 15, 26].
* [cite_start]**Real-time Visibility**: Interactive dashboards provide performance analytics and recovery insights[cite: 17, 23].

### 🏗️ Technology Stack
* [cite_start]**AI/ML**: Python-based models for recovery prediction[cite: 20, 34].
* [cite_start]**Automation**: Workflow automation to manage feedback loops and tracking[cite: 21].
* [cite_start]**Integration**: RPA logic concepts for connecting with FedEx legacy systems[cite: 22].
* [cite_start]**UI/UX**: Streamlit-based secure portal for DCA collaboration[cite: 24, 36].

### 📂 Repository Structure
* [cite_start]`/app`: Contains `dashboard.py` (The working UI prototype)[cite: 36].
* [cite_start]`/model`: Contains `priority_engine.py` (AI logic for prioritization)[cite: 34].
* `requirements.txt`: Dependencies needed to run the demo.

### 📈 Expected Value Proposition
* [cite_start]**Reduced Overdue Ageing**: Faster collection cycles through data-driven decisions[cite: 26, 29].
* [cite_start]**Enhanced Accountability**: Clear ownership and audit trails for every case[cite: 10, 16].
* [cite_start]**Scalability**: A future-ready solution built to handle increasing account volumes[cite: 13, 30].
